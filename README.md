# Around You
Around You is an iOS app that allows users to discover nearby places based on their current location and search for specific places based on their favorite food. It provides a user-friendly interface with various features to enhance the user's experience.

## Features
- **Current Location:** The app uses the device's GPS feature to accurately determine the user's current location.
- **Search Filter:** Users can find nearby places based on their interests for example Library, Cafe, movie theatre, and much more.
- **Nearby Places:** The app fetches a list of all nearby places that offer the user's place of interest with annotation. Users can browse through the list and explore various options.
- **Animated Selection:** When the user selects a place from the list, the app provides a visually appealing animation to highlight the selected place, improving the overall user experience.
- **Detail Screen:** Upon tapping on a selected place, the app displays a detailed screen with comprehensive information about that place and which leads user to fetch direction or call that place.
- **Directions via Apple Maps:** Near Me integrates with Apple Maps, enabling users to get exact directions to their favorite place with just one click. This feature enhances the user's convenience and navigation experience.
- **Call Feature:** Users can directly call any favorite place from within the app. This feature eliminates the need to manually search for a place's contact information and streamlines the process of making reservations or inquiries.
